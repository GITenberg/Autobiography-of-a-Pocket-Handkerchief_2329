description: Set in Paris and New York in the 1830s, this fable is narrated by a pocket
  handkerchief, an article which at that time was used more for show than for blow.
  It is, thus, distinguished for its beauty rather than for the function of ordinary
  handkerchiefs. It begins its autobiography by establishing its ancestry back through
  several generations of flax plants, starting in America and then moving to France
  when a large shipment of flaxseed was captured by a French privateer. Every flax
  plant and its linen offspring enjoy a special kind of clairvoyance which unites
  their perceptions with those of both their vegetable ancestors and their human associates.
  For this reason all pieces of linen are wiser and better informed than is generally
  supposed, and the observations of a sophisticated pocket handkerchief provide a
  most fitting vehicle for the broad social satire of the story.
